/*	OOP(Object oriented programming):
 * Object oriented programming is just a way of writing code and classes and objects are the basic
 * parts of this method.
 * Why should we learn the OOP?
 * 1. Because OOP simplifies the development of programs
 * 2. It makes it easy to manage and maintain large programs.
 * 3.OOP is built around objects classes and many other
 *  things which can help us translate real
 * life objects into computers.
 * 
 * How to write programs using OOP.
 * We:
 * 1) create classes and inside the classes define properties/fields/attributes
 *  to translate how an object from real life looks like
 *  2) create methods/behaviours/functions to define how that 
 *  thing works in real life
 *  
 *  Note:
 *  OOP is also supported in many other programming languages like C#,PHP,PYTON,JAVASCRIPT ETC.
 *  Other than OOP we also have different paradigm or ways of writing code 
 *  functional programming is one of them and we also have procedural programming.
 *  
 * OOP is justy a set of rules we follow when writing the code.
 * 
 * How do we create a class and its object:
 * 	class Human{
 * String name;    //attributes/properties/fields
 * int age;
 * double weight;
 * char gender;
 * 
 * void walk(){  	//methods/functions/behaviours
 * System.out.println("I can walk");
 * }
 * 
in JAVA its convention to call the ATTRIBUTES--->FIELDS and call the
BEHAVIOURS---->  METHODS
public static void main(String [] agrs){

Human sameer=new Human();
sameer.name="Naughty Sameer";
sameer.age=20;
sameer.weight=90;
sameer.gender='M';
sameer.walk();
	
		
Rules:
1)we can define the fields and methods anywhere in the class.
2)
